Hey there! I’m Avadhoot. Currently, I am in my final year, pursuing a B.Tech degree in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) at IIT Bombay. I have completed a minor in department of [Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/). My primary interest lies in AI and machine learning, with a special fascination for computer vision and Natural Language Processing.

I’m originally from Varvand, in Pune district, where I completed my education up to the 10th grade before moving to Baramati for JEE preparation. Recently, I completed an internship at Adobe Inc. in the Media and Data Science Research (MDSR) lab, where I worked on various computer vision topics, including image editing, diffusion models, and multimodal vision-language models (VLMs).

 Outside of work and studies, you can find me watching cricket, scrolling through reels, or relaxing with some good Marathi and Hindi music.
